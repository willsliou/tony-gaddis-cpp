// End of Chapter 2: Review Questions and Exercises

characters use ' '
string literals use " "

NOTE TO SELF: operators are the ones "operating (like +, -), operands are the values being operated on (5 + 5, 5 are the operands)
1. Unary requires 1 operand like increment and negative, negations (x++, -x, !x)
  Binary operators require 2 operands each. (5 + 5) The plus operator requires two operands (the two 5's).
  Ternary operators require 3 operands each. (if else in C++)

2. double age, temp, weight;  
3. int months = 2, days, years = 3;

  Strange questions about executing undefined variables on repl.it:
  1. when you run with return 0, you get back the max of the int (32765). Why do we get back the max value? variable days isn't defined?
  
  int main() {
    cout << days << endl; 
    return 0;
  }
  
  2. but when you run it WITHOUT return 0, you get back 0 Is it returning back the status? (0 is the status of the program, it has finished running)
    
    int main() {
      cout << days << endl;
    }
    
 4.   
 A) 
  double a;
  double b = a + 2;
 B) 
  double b;
  double a = b * 4;
 C) 
  double a;
  double b = a / 3.14;
 D) 
  double b;
  double a = b - 8;
 E)
  double a = 27;
 F)
  char c = 'K';
 G)
  char c = 66; // ASCII A = 65
  
5. /* */ is multi-line comments

7. "\n" or << endl; at each cout statement
