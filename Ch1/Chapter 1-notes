> Concept: Computers can do many different jobs beause they are programmable.

Programs should be carefully designed
The following is designed for real world program:
* Logical flow of the instructions (code)
* Mathematical procedures (logic)
* Appearance of the screens (design()
* Way information is presented to user (UI)
* Program user-friendliness (UI)
* Manuals, written documentation (docs)

1. Hardware - system of devices
  1. The central processing unit (CPU)
  2. Main memory (RAM)
  3. Secondary storage devices (SSD solid state drive, HDD hard disk drive)
  4. Input devices (Keyboard, mouse, usb)
  5. Output devices (speakers, monitor, printers)
  
2. CPU (central processing unit)
  Job: Fetch and follow instructions (input), and produce a result (output)
  The CPU is consisted of two parts that interact with each other: 
    ** Control unit ** *coordinates computer operations; *
    **Arithmetic and logic unit** *performs mathematical operations*
  
  Whenever a CPU runs a program, it goes through these sequence of steps:
  1. Fetch - from the control unit, fetch instructions from main memory
  2. Decode - decode instruction, generate electrical signal
  3. Execute - route signal to desginated computer device 
Main memory - RAM (random access memory)
1. Holds memory
